# Documentation

**Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap**. 

- Buttons should clearly indicate the action that they will trigger either by proximity or by using clear verbs or command as text.
- It is recommended that buttons have no more than three words in them to aid in their 'scanability'.

For example:

```html
// Bad

<Button>Click Here</Button>
```

```html
// Bad

<Button>Permanently delete this item from the remote database</Button>
```

```html
// Good

<Button>Add Story</Button>
```
